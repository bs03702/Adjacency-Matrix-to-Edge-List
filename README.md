#Adjacency Matrix to Edge List

This is a simple Python script to convert any given [adjacency matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) into an edge list.
The tool can be interesting for anyone working with graph analysis. The git also includes an IPython Notebook file (***.ipynb**) with the script.
