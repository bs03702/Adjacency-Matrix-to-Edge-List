#Adjacency Matrix to Edge List

This simple Python script helps to convert any given [adjacency matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) into an edge list.

The tool can be interesting for anyone working with graph analyis, as most programs such as Gephi require edge lists as an input. That being said, this script is recommended for complementary use outside of MATLAB or R/Python libraries such as [igraph](http://igraph.org/r/doc/conversion.html) or [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/convert.html), as they are well-provided with similar functionalities.

Use
-----

1.  Use an adjacency matrix with a structure as provided in **matrix.csv**
2.  Make sure **matrix.csv** is in the same folder as **adjacencymatrix_to_edgelist.py**
3.  Open Terminal and navigate to your folder
5.  run ```python adjacencymatrix_to_edgelist.py```
6.  Voil√†. Open **edge_list.csv** and be happy :)

The repository comes with an IPython Notebook file (***.ipynb**).
